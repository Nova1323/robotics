# Robotics

This repository contains links to courses, guides, books and tutorials that will help you learn robotics.

## 1. Coding

### 1.1 Linux

First of all start with learning and getting familiar with Linux system. A great place to start here is Ubuntu as it is very user friendly and has a huge community for support. 

Running basic commands from the terminal like changing directories, building program files etc. are enough to get you started.

You can find a free course to on Linux command line basics by Udacity [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud595).

### 1.2 Programming Languages used in Robotics.

The two most common languages used to program robots are *C++* and *Python*.

Python is a place to start if you are not familiar with programming. The language is easy to learn and with the help of so many libraries developed for Python one can make scripts quickly. You can find free courses to learn Python on Coursera [Python for Everbody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=06-PythonforEverybody-IN&utm_content=B2C&campaignid=6495128536&adgroupid=79383894233&device=c&keyword=online%20python%20courses&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=415503606230&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5-WRBhCKARIsAAId9FnH5VyW4yTRD3R4_JhuDMEgi79ItqRAmcRN3ubh_0Bo5Gbu_993InwaAgkiEALw_wcB) by the Univeristy of Michigan is a great course. You can also find videos on Youtube [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/c/sentdex) and [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) are channels that I would definitly recommend.

While Python is easier to understand and write programs in it is slow when it comes to execution hence C++ is the most popular language that is used to program robots. You can go through the [C++ for Programmers](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud210) course on Udacity which covers C++ right from printing hello world to complex OOP concepts and vectors along with some interview questions. [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) is also a great place to learn C++ along with other channels like [CodeBeauty](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl5-BV9aRaeDVohpE4sqJiQ) and [Code with Harry (Hindi)](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithHarry).

After this you can improve your skills by practicing on websites like [HackerRank](hackerrank.com) and making your own robots/projects.

## 2. Electronics.

Understanding the basics of electronics is a must for an Robotics Engineer. Knowing how to read a datasheet, soldering, wiring are somethings people generally look over.

If you are interested in electronics knowing how to design circuts is obvious. To do so you can start from building your first project be it as a Remote Controlled Car. Here you will learn how to build and connect motors, motor controllers and program microcontrollers. You can even add a bluetooth and use your phone as controller.

## 3. ROS

The Robot Operating System(ROS) is a framework unlike its name suggets. ROS is used to make robots by students, researchers and industries.

To get started with ROS there is no better place than [ros.org](ros.org) itself. You can find detailed instructions for installing ROS on your system here. Next you can head over to the [ros wiki's Tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) page to learn ROS.

I also recommend buying the courses on Udemy made by Anis Kubba on ROS. The three course series starts from the basics and ends with you running your own Autonomous robot is a simulation as well as in real life.
